NAME
	_printf, it is a function to print formatted output conversion

LIBRARY

SYNOPSIS
	#include "main.h"
	int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
	The function _printf() produce output according to a format as described
	below. It writes output to stdout, the standard output stream.
	
Conversion specifiers
	d, i	The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
            The default precision is 1.

	c		If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted
            to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

	s		the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array 
			of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the 
			array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null 
			byte ('\0').

	%		A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete 
			conversion specification is '%%'.

RETURN VALUE
	Upon successful return, these functions return the number of
    characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to
	strings). If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
